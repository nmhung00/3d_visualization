The main idea is in file simpleDrawing.cpp:
All the points and positions are stored in vector<vector<float>*> points, where points[i] is the position and respective points.
For each points[i], the first three numbers are the coordinates of camera position, then each three numbers after that are the coordinates of the points around that position.
Each time draw() is called, points and positions from points[0] to points[counter] will be drawn. Counter will increase from 0 to points.size()


To compile and run: (With libQGLViewer and Qt installed)
make
./simpleDrawing
